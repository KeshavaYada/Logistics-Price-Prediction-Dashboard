## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Features

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the core features of the Logistics Price Prediction Dashboard:

- **üîÆ Predictive Analytics**: Employs **linear regression** to analyze historical data, allowing the model to predict target prices effectively.
  
- **üìä Dynamic Visualizations**: Developed using **Power BI**, the dashboard includes interactive visuals, powered by **Power Query** for data transformations and **DAX** for parameterization.

- **üßë‚Äçüíª User Inputs**: User-friendly interface that allows input of critical variables such as:
  - üìç **Current Location**
  - üõ£Ô∏è **Distance**
  - üöõ **Number of Vehicles**

- **‚õΩ Real-time Diesel Rates Integration**: Automatically retrieves and incorporates live diesel prices from Google for real-time accuracy, reducing the need for manual inputs and enhancing the model‚Äôs precision.

- **üìà Price Comparison & Outlier Detection**: Continuously compares predicted prices with actual prices and utilizes **box-whisker plots** for detecting outliers, ensuring predictions remain accurate and up-to-date.

- **üìà Enhanced Accuracy**: The dashboard‚Äôs predictive accuracy is boosted to **85%**, especially for common vehicle types like trucks and high-bed trailers, thanks to ongoing model fine-tuning.

- **üìÖ Historical Data Utilization**: Leverages historical data in visual form to offer users a comprehensive view of potential price ranges, aiding in understanding price variation.

- **üìä Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provides holistic insights into logistics pricing, combining historical and current data inputs for robust, informed decision-making.

- **üìà Transparent Improvement Tracking**: Regular updates to the dashboard reflect continuous improvements in prediction accuracy, promoting a clear view of the project‚Äôs commitment to quality.

- **‚ú® Streamlined User Experience**: Focused on user experience, ensuring that predictions are easily accessible, accurate, and based on recent data inputs. Feedback loops were also integrated for continuous improvement.
